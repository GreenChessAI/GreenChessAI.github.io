<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p> This project involves creating an AI that can play the game of chess against a human player at three different levels.
  The AI must abide by a unique rule set put in place while also making calculated and effective moves against the player. 
  This project will need a machine learning algorithm for the AI to make its decisions as well as an algorithm for the rule set of the game.
  A graphical user interface will be implemented to display everything to the user and give them an enjoyable experience.
  In the end, we aim to create a new and exciting chess experience for players while also giving them a challenging but fair AI to test their abilities against.
