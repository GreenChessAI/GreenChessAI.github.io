	<h2>Abstract:</h2>
	<p> 
	The field of AI is constantly expanding and is on track to competely revolutionize our way of life. We seek to use this project as an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of working with AI by creating a computer opponent in a slightly modified version of Chess. These modifications create greater complexity in terms of the amount of possible moves and some add restrictions on player freedom, making it interesting to see how the AI will react to these changes when compared to a traditional chess computer opponent. Our AI uses the minimax algorithm in order to assign numerical values to various positions and attempts to reach highly valued positions by working backwards. On top of the AI, we have created a functional Chess game using Unity and made some modifications to how the game works. Our AI is able to offer a competitive and challenging experience without being too frustrating.
